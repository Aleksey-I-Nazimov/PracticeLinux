The linux file root is determined by the /

media - is a folder of the flash and media devices

inode is a system file ID. Type, user rights are linked to the respective inode
inode is the primary. The respective file name is a secondary attribute.
One physical file can point on different files with file names.
There are soft and hard link in linux. Hard link points on the inode. Soft link points on
the file name. 
ls -l: type | user_rights| number of links| creator name | creator group | size | creation date | file-name
 type-> d = directory, b= device file, c= symbol file, s= socket,
            p= named pipe - = basic file l - soft link
 rwxrwxrwx-> 
    r read for creator
    w write for creator (or removing directory)
    x execution for creator (getting directory attributes)
    r read for creator group
    w write for creator group (or removing directory)
    x execution for creator group (getting directory attributes)
    r read for others
    w write for others (or removing directory)
    x execute for others (getting directory attributes)

suid
  suid =1. When somebody wants to execute the file with suid=1 then original creator
    will be checked
  sgid =1 When somebody wants to execute the file  with sgid =1 the original creator group
   will be checked
  Sticky sticky=1 means removing can be performed by the creator only

The main root directories:
  sbin - the main system binary files
  boot - the main file  of the system loader
  dev - the main devices folder. All hardware files
  etc - the main config files for all software. 
  home - user files
  lib - libraries of system binaries
  mnt - alternative mount folder
  root - the selected directory for the root home
  tmp - the sticky bit catalog for temporarl  file
  usr - the user developed software binaries and sources
  var - the catalogs of log files

# Show disk info:
 >> df -h -T -t ext4
# Show disks with inode limit info
 >> df -h -T -t ext4 -i
# Show file tree for media. Media is the main mount  pointer
 >> tree /media
# Creating hard link
 >> ln origin hard_link_name
# Creating soft link
 >> ln origin soft_link_name

# The direct copy is not a link (soft or hard) Hard linked files are updated by the system
# The soft link is a link by name
# The simple copy makes a new file with copied content
# Soft link is broken when origin is removed or renamed. Hard link is not broken for file naming
# Hard link is stable for deleting and renaming
# Hard link copies all rights
# Hard link is not created for folder
# Soft link is broken when the origin is moved to another directory
# The file is removed fully when there are no any hard links for this file

# Showing files with their inodes
 >> ls -li

chmod go -rw *

# USER rights -> rwx GROUP -> rw OTHERS -> r
chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file1
chmod a=rw *

# Adding SUID for user executable files
>> chmod u+s *
# SUID is working for executable files S means no rights for x of the creator

# Adding SGID for group
>> chmod g+s *

# Adding Sticky
>> chmod +t

>> chown user file_name
>> chown :user_group file_name

# recursive changing rights
>> chown user file_name -r
